         * If you expose a public collection property, you prevent from adding/removing

         * 
         * Items[0].Quantity ++; 
         * 
         * You can't block setters on Quantity as OrderItems must be set when preparing 
         * the order request.
         * a) You expose order items through a different type with private setters and 
         *    not using Product as a reference!
         * b) You may even return a clone of Items if for some reason you need to make sure
         *    that the original collection is not touched.
         *    
         * Simplest way to handle this is using different types, which leads towards CQRS.
         * 
         * Simplest way to handle this in DDD is handling updates on an order through a different 
         * object such OrderUpdateRequest. And just return Items as is, but just ignoring any 
         * changes it may run into.
